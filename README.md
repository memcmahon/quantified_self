# Quantified-Self Ruby on Rails

This is one of three identical APIs build as part of the [Quantified Self](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self) project while at Turing.  Built over 2 days using Ruby on Rails, this is a RESTful JSON API that is designed to be used as a daily meal tracker.

The [endpoints](#endpoints) below can be explored using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or your preferred client.  This API is deployed at https://infinite-retreat-10591.herokuapp.com/
